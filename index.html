    <p>
        Here we have a graphic about popularity of UFCG computer science course flowchart. <br>
        Each box is a semester and each circle is a graduated student in a specific semester <br>
        (from her/his first to her/his last semester). The y axis corresponds to the number of courses <br>
        (he/she did at this i-th semester) that correspond to the indicated at the flowchart. <br>
        If you select some students (circles) at a box, they will be also selected at the rest of boxes, <br>
        so you can see how a specific student (or a group of students) followed what the course flowchart indicates. <br>
